  summary: A Python package for time series classification

  description: |
    pyts is a Python package for time series transformation and classification.
    It aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing
    preprocessing and utility tools, and implementations of state-of-the-art
    algorithms. Most of these algorithms transform time series, thus pyts
    provides several tools to perform these transformations.
